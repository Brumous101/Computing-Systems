For the following questions, read chapter 1 of "How A Computer Works". The answers to questions 4-12 are contained in this book. 

4) Jon Von Neumann was the inventor of one of the first modern computers from the 1940s

5) A CPU is similar to a calculator because the CPU copies bytes of information from the memory map to it's registers and then
is able to perform simple operations on the bytes. They are also similar as they are always waiting for human inputs when turned
on.

6) The Program Counter holds the memory address of the current instruction.

7) A CPU mnemonics is a key phrase that makes remembering the opcodes inside a computer easier.

8) The three main types of Computer Memory is RAM, ROM, and hard drives. 

9) ESD is Electro Static Discharge and happens when the electrostatic levels between two objects are uneven.

10) The purpose of ROM is so the CPU can follow instructions upon startup and always know where to go to find it. It is also
not able to be overwritten.

11) POST stands for Power On Self Test code and the purpose of POST is to check and see if all the componenets are in place
upon startup.

12) Secondary storage or Mass storage is memory that is not located inside of the computer's memory map. Examples are
hard drives, flash drives, CDROMs, DVDs, and magnetic tapes.
